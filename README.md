### What is InventorBot?
InventorBot is a functional Discord bot that works seamlessly on your server of choice!

### What is Discord?
Discord is an awesome free voice and text server, kinda like Slack and TeamSpeak merged together in awesomeness, and it's free! Did I mention it's free? Anyway, read more [here](https://discordapp.com/).

### How did you make this?!
I made InventorBot in an API called `discord.js` with Node.JS and JavaScript. They're all pretty cool.

### How do I get it to do...stuff?
Once again, easy! Head on over to [Add InventorBot](//inventor02.me/add/inventorbot) and click on the big blue button! It couldn't be easier!

### Can I self-host the bot?
Hmm, that's a tough one. The project is open source ([psst, check it out](https://github.com/inventor02/inventorbot)), so in theory, **yes**. However, there is not yet a way to easily do this. Don't worry, @inventor02 is working hard on it :D

### I found a bug!
Great! Well, not great, but great if I can fix it! Head on over to the [issues](https://github.com/inventor02/inventorbot/issues) page and report it there! I'll get right to it!

### I need...something else!
Chances are, I can make that 'something else' happen. Message me on Discord at `inventor02#4201` (legendary ID, I know) and I'll do my best to help!
