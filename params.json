  "body": "### What is InventorBot?\r\nInventorBot is a functional Discord bot that works seamlessly on your server of choice!\r\n\r\n### What is Discord?\r\nDiscord is an awesome free voice and text server, kinda like Slack and TeamSpeak merged together in awesomeness, and it's free! Did I mention it's free? Anyway, read more [here](http://discordapp.com).\r\n\r\n### How did you make this?!\r\nI made InventorBot in an API called `discord.js` with Node.JS and JavaScript. They're all pretty cool.\r\n\r\n### How do I get it to do...stuff?\r\nOnce again, easy! Head on over to [Add InventorBot](http://inventor02.me/inventorbot/add/) and click on the big blue button! It couldn't be easier!\r\n\r\n### Can I self-host the bot?\r\nHmm, that's a tough one. The project is open source ([psst, check it out](https://github.com/inventor02/inventorbot)), so in theory, yes. However, there is not **yet** a way to easily do this. Don't worry, @inventor02 is working hard on it :D\r\n\r\n### I found a bug!\r\nGreat! Well, not great, but great if I can fix it! Head on over to the [issues](https://github.com/inventor02/inventorbot) page and report it there! I'll get right to it!\r\n\r\n### I need...something else!\r\nChances are, I can make that 'something else' happen. Message me on Discord at `inventor02#4201` (legendary ID, I know) and I'll do my best to help!",
